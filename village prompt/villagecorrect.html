<h1></h1>

<h2>With slight resistance, you manage to tell the man that you "don't trust the voice".</h2>
<h2>Immediate relief washed over the man as he started to <br> spill information about the voice, world, and himself.</h2>
<h2>He gradually told you that the voice is trying to get <br> rid of all sub-species besides from their own.</h2>
<h2>That cute monster that you fought back there, it was consumed with rage, it didn't know itself. <br> It used to be a person too... before "that" happened.</h2>
<h2>The many prompts that you have been through, <br> each one has a loved one perish due to your choices.</h2>
