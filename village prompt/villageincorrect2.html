<h1></h1>

<h2>From the distance you could see a disheveled body walking towards you. <br> At this current time and place you think nothing of it.</h2>
<h2>You've noticed some weird things happening within this world <br> however you respond to the man: "I'm still deciding".</h2>
<h2>You could almost sense a sigh of relief from the man.</h2>
<h2>Clenching the weapon that the voice gave you tightly, <br> you are further reminded of your worldly goals.</h2>
