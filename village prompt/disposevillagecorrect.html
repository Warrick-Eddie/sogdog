<h2>The voice pulls you to the side and desperately pleads with you. <br> You start to slowly realize your situation.</h2>
<h2>"Hey, this village is absolutely crawling with vermin, <br> you need to kill the entire village. Pronto."</h2>
<h2>"Don't you understand your situation? <br>The last time that you wandered away from my option, you almost died?"</h2>
<h2>The voice's aura is screaming at you with the words "Trust me" over and over again. <br> Your mindset is clear.</h2>
