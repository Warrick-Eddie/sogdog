<h1></h1>

<h2>A man from the village approaches you and tells you to not trust the voice.</h2>
<h2>Instead, you haphazardly spit back words that resemble "you're crazy" at his face. </h2>
<h2>Nothing could control the amount of aggression within your voice. Nothing was wrong. Yet.</h2>
<h2>The man looked at your eyes, and tried to muster some words. <br> Alas, he gave up and returned the way he came.</h2>
