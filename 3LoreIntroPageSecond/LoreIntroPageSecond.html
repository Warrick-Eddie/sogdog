                The Mundane Life of an Officeworker
            </h1>

            <p>
Unfortunately, the life of an officeworker, though simple, was unfulfilling.
            </p>
            <p>
Everyday was filled with the same, repetitive, boring tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
He had to do his own chores, commute on public transport, and worst of all...
            </p>
            <p>
He could not eat the luxurious food he once enjoyed as a prince.
            </p>
            <p>
(He also had no friends but that is beside the point I guess.)
            </p>
            <p>
He had become sick of this lifestyle.
            </p>
            <p>
As always Salix was working overtime. The day was average and boring, just like it was everyday.
            </p>
            <p>
He finds himself become dreary and begins to fall asleep...
            </p>
