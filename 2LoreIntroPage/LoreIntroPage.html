                The Prince Who Became an Officeworker
            </h1>

            <p>
                Once upon a time there was a prince who had dreams.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dreams to contribute to something bigger than himself (a giant company). 
                Dreams to create (word documents). 
                Dreams to live...
            </p>
            <p>
                ...as an officeworker...
            </p>
            <p>
                ...
            </p>
            <p>
                Did I hear that correctly? Seriously? Nevermind...
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately (for obvious reasons) his parents (the literal king and queen) did not aprove.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Don't be ridiculous!" they scoffed (and rightfully so). They did not support his dreams.
            </p>
            <p>
                So the prince did the only thing he could think of...
            </p>
            <p>
                He renounced his title and moved to the big city to become an officeworker.
            </p>
            <p>
                And so he lived happily ever after...
            </p>
