<h2>You come across a village that seems to have an unruly feel. <br> Almost like the atmosphere has been shattered by something.</h2>
<h2>You head towards the center of the village in an attempt to gain information and supplies.</h2>
<h2>A man approaches you steadily, with the his clear intentions of asking you something. <br> "Excuse me?"</h2>
<h2>"Please don't trust the voice. It's incredibly dangerous for you.</h2>
<h2>What do you do?</h2>
