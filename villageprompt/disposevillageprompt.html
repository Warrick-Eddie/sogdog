    <h2>The voice brings you to the side and tells you some important information.</h2>
    <h2>"You see this village? It's full of monsters that are contaminating this world.</h2>
    <h2>It's like finding trash at the bottom of your shoe. Absolutely disgraceful to the goddess of this world.</h2>
    <h2>You'll trust me right? Won't you kill these monsters with me?</h2>
