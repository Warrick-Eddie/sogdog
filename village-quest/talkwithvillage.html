<h2>Disregarding what the voice said completely, you move forward into the village with determination.</h2>
<h2>You reconvene with the man from before, and the man begins to talk of an old tale.</h2>
<h2>"An era ago, there was this ancient weapon able to vanquish the voice. Yggdrasil's branch." </h2>
<h2>"Are you willing to go through the trials necessary to get the trust of us villagers"</h2>
<h2>By this point, you've made a decision you can no longer turn back on. <br> You have to continue.</h2>
