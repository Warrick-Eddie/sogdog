<h2>You enter the first door towards your left and <br> get immediately hit with the smell of roses and lavender.</h2>
<h2>You look in the direction of the scent and your brain resets your vision, <br> making you see the vase on the table. </h2>
<h2>The smell being replaced with a dusty manor, <br> the type that hasn't been managed in a very long time. </h2>
<h2>Second thoughts plague your mind as the dust settles on your armour. You start to head out to the front.</h2>
<h2>You see only a door surrounded in thorny vines and overgrown thickets of grass.</h2>
