    <h1></h1>

    <h2>You enter the door right in the middle, expecting some <br> mysterious or great monster to appear for additional experience.</h2>
    <h2>Your thoughts were shaken up by seeing similar objects placed around the area.</h2>
    <h2>You had realized that you were walking in the same corridor <br> as you see the same vase and table for the fifth time in a row.</h2>
    <h2>Although you have not learnt how to get out of this predicament, <br> you decided to leave in search of a new lead.</h2>
    <h2>You step out of the entrance and a bright light burns your eyes, <br> but you still feel like you have seen this before.</h2>
