<h2>You turn around from the village and start heading towards the ominous castle in the distance.</h2>
<h2>Multiple monsters stand in your way as you brutally throw them to the side with your weapon.</h2>
<h2>Shrieks and sniffling can be heard in the distance whilst you stand your guard, awaiting orders. </h2>
<h2>By this point, the castle's door is in front of you but you see three entrances. <br> What do you do now that you have trampled over many corpses?</h2>
