    <h2>Personally I don't believe you have enough strength to save our world.</h2>
    <h2>Getting that question wrong has me wondering...<br> are you really going to save us?</h2>
    <h2>No matter, we can wait as long as possible for our next hero. In the next millennia.</h2>
    <h2>Come back when you have more strength. Godspeed.</h2>
